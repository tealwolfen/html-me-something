                <p>Supergiant Games composer Darren Korb gives Transistor a large range music. The music changes
                   depending on situation the characters find themselves end. The game has blue tint to it taught
                   that music matches perfectly.</p>

                <h2>Mass Effect</h2>
                <img src="images/masseffectdialogue.jpg" alt="Mass Effect dialogue wheel" />
                <p> While playing Mass Effect I gain a deeper apperciation for world building and giving every 
                    character motivation for their actions. Also the importance of voice actors are for adding 
                    dramactic tension do a scene. </p>

                <h2>Valkyria Chronicles</h2>
                <img src="images/valkyriachronicles.jpg" alt="Valkyria Chronicles Tank" width="650" height="365" controls />
                <p>Valkyria Chronicles aesthetic puts it above many games. The story is told through journal entries of
                    the main character. The menu is shown in the form of a book and watercolor design give the game a 
                    bedtime story effect.  </p>
